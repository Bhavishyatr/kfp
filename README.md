## If I Had More Time

If I had more time to work on this project, I would have added or improved the following:

- **Error Boundaries:** Implement React error boundaries to gracefully handle unexpected errors in the UI.
- **Better Reuse of Hooks:** Refactor and generalize custom hooks for improved code reuse and maintainability.
- **More Descriptive Error Messages:** Provide users with clearer, more actionable error messages throughout the app.
- **Retry Logic:** Add retry mechanisms for failed network requests to improve resilience.
- **Better Error Pages:** Create custom error pages for 404, 500, and other error states for a more polished user experience.
- **Add Unit Tests:** Setup and expand test coverage, especially for edge cases and error handling, to ensure reliability.
